# Nonogram

[![demo](http://i.imgur.com/XRs3jk7.gif)](https://Lucas-C.github.io/Nonogram)

This is a fork of the original awesome nonogram (also known as hanjie, picross and griddlers) editor and solver by HandsomeOne.

I only added the load from file / save as PNG features.

To retrieve the hints as arrays from the "Create Your Own Nonogram" editor section:

    JSON.stringify(window.advEditor1.hints)

For some grids samples, check:
- the [grids/](grids/) directory of this repo
- [Patrick Labatut gallery](http://www.normalesup.org/~labatut/IK3/)
